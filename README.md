# Chinese-anesthesia-dataset
This is an anesthesia prediction dataset mainly used in Chinese. We provide Chinese and English versions of some data here. You can view some data here, or you can get all the data with the author's consent.

Here we provide two txt files, which are the Chinese and English versions of our 100 data.
record-chinese.txt is the Chinese data of anesthesia risk prediction.
record-english.txt is the English data of anesthesia risk prediction.

The English anesthesia data here are directly translated from the Chinese data we collected. The purpose is to facilitate understanding. The Chinese version is still the main language used.

You can obtain all the data from [Chinese Anesthesia Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/13378270) with the permission of the corresponding author（please refer to the Data Availability part）
